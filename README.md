# 🌐 Web-Scraping 🌐

**Web Scraping** is the practice of gathering data through any means other than a program interacting with an API (or, obviously, through a human using a web browser). This is most commonly accomplished by writing an automated program that queries a web server, requests data (usually in the form of the HTML and other files that comprise web pages), and then parses that data to extract needed information.
Although web scraping is not a new term, in years past the practice has been more commonly known as screen scraping, data mining, web harvesting.


***1. Web-Scraping using Pandas:- (pandas)[https://pandas.pydata.org/] is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language. Here using this library we scrape the html data from a website. NOTE: IT IS A BASIC DEMO OF WEB SCRAPING.***
